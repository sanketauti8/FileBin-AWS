AWS S3 File Upload using Pre-signed URLs with React and Node.js

This project demonstrates how to upload files to an AWS S3 bucket using pre-signed URLs. The implementation involves a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js. The AWS SDK is used to interact with the S3 bucket, and IAM user credentials are utilized for secure access. The pre-signed URLs generated by the backend have a short expiration time of 60 seconds to ensure secure and temporary access.


**Features**
Secure File Uploads: Utilizes pre-signed URLs to securely upload files to S3 without exposing credentials.
Time-Limited URLs: Pre-signed URLs expire after 60 seconds, enhancing security.
AWS SDK Integration: Seamless integration with AWS S3 using the AWS SDK.
React Frontend: A responsive frontend built with React for user-friendly file uploads.
Node.js Backend: A robust backend in Node.js for generating pre-signed URLs and handling file upload logic.

**Configuration**
**AWS S3 Bucket Configuration**
**Create an S3 Bucket:**

Go to the S3 console in AWS and create a new bucket.
Configure the bucket with the necessary permissions and policies to allow file uploads.

**IAM User Credentials:**

Create an IAM user with permissions to access the S3 bucket.
Generate access keys for the IAM user.


This project provides a secure and efficient way to upload files to an AWS S3 bucket using pre-signed URLs. By leveraging the power of React and Node.js, you can create a scalable solution for handling file uploads with enhanced security measures.
